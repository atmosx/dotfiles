# atmosx dotfiles

CLI configuration files (dotfiles) that I use daily on multiple computers.

## Goodies

I'm using the [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) package manager. These applications must be installed via MacPorts for a smooth setup:

- MacPorts:
    - autojump - jump around
    - direnv - environment manager
    - git-delta - modern diff viewer
    - stow - as a dotfile manager
    - tmux - use `<bind> + I` to install the plugins!
        - tmuxinator - tmux session manager
    - vim 9.x +python312 +tcl +cscope +lua 
        - python v3.12.x (via vim)
        - fzf - modern fuzzy finder
        - shellcheck - syntax highlighting, used by vim "Ale" plugin
        - pretier  - syntax highlighting, used by vim "Ale" plugin
    - programming languages
        - golang - doesn't require a version manager \o/
        - nvm - nodeJS version manager
        - rbenv - ruby version manager
        - ruby-build
- [0xProto Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for terminal.
